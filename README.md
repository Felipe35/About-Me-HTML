# 📱 iPhone Portfolio Simulation

This project is a **personal portfolio experiment** built with only **HTML and CSS**, where I simulate the look and feel of an iPhone interface.  
The goal is to create a minimal and interactive space to show a few things about me, and later optimize it into a **full portfolio**, or help as an idea for future creative implementation using frameworks and modularization.
